#Executive Summary:
#Social determinants of health factors including employment status, education, population density, living environment and insurance status
#may have a positive correlation with the rate of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. The races with the highest number of individuals with 
#chronic diseases are African Americans, White Americans, and multi-racial Americans across all 50 states. Future efforts to improve health
#equity may include African Americans, White Americans, and multi-racial Americans as target populations as they are the races with the
#highest number of chronic diseases across the U.S. Internet access may also have a positive correlation with COVID-19 deaths: as the number
#of households with internet access increases in Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana, so does the COVID-19 death count.Individuals who lack
#knowledge in the prevention of COVID-19 may be more susceptible to death due to COVID-19.The states
#with the highest frequency of households without access to the internet are California, Texas, New York, and Florida.
